# Accomplish something that looks like this:
# ngrok start --all --config=config/ngrok.yml
#
# Issues to resolve:
# 1. Resolve the path of the ngrok config file
# 2. Resolve the issues with the ExecutionPolicy to allow running the script. Determine the right one
#    and update the README.md to instruct devs to set it up before attempting to start the tunnel.
