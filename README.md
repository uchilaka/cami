## This again?

Yep! Pivoting back to:

- **1 database ORM** PostgreSQL for all the magical things out of the box i.e. active record, active storage, action mailbox
- **A much simplified data model** with a focus on the core features of the app (no more profiles, STI account classes ...woof)

For detailed setup notes, go [here](./md/SETUP_NOTES.md).

## Ruby Version

- `3.2.2`

## Service/Vendor dependencies

- [**Ngrok**](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/cloud-edge/domains) for local development tunneling

## System Dependencies

System dependencies are defined in the following configuration files:

- `.tool-versions` (see `.tool-versions.example`)
- `Gemfile`
- `Brewfile`
- `package.json`
  - `yarn.lock`

## Pre-installation

### Setup GPG key with your GitHub account 

To export an existing GPG (public) key, run the following commands:

```shell
# Show existing GPG keys
gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format=long

# Substitute "ID" for your longform GPG key ID
gpg --armor --export GPG key ID
```

Then follow [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/adding-a-gpg-key-to-your-github-account#adding-a-gpg-key) to add it to your GitHub account.

## Running the app for the first time

### 1. Setup the environment

> If you use [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/guide/introduction.html), you will also need to setup the following plugins
> and install their corresponding versions with the `asdf install` command:
>
> ```shell
> # Install Ruby version manager
> asdf plugin add ruby
> # Install NodeJS version manager
> asdf plugin add nodejs
> ```
>
> New to `asdf`? [here's a primer to get started](https://asdf-vm.com/guide/getting-started.html).

Review the `.env.example` file to ensure the environment variables are set. You can
control which variables are made available in each environment while working locally
using the following files:

- `.env.local`
- `.env.test`

The `.envrc` (see `.envrc.example`) file should be included for compatibility with
other features like `docker compose` and simply sources the `.env.local` file.

### 2. Check your Yarn version

If you're still on Yarn `1.x`, you will likely see an error related to that when you start working with the app.

To setup Yarn `4.x` for this project (this won't affect your `1.x` installation on your system), checkout [this guide](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install).

### 3. Install dependencies

```shell
# Install system dependencies
brew bundle
# Setup the ASDF dependencies file
cp -v .tool-versions.example .tool-versions
# Set bundler location
bundle config set --local path ./vendor/bundle
# Install Ruby dependencies
bundle install
# Install Node dependencies
yarn install
```

### 4. Setup a GPG key for your Github account

Follow [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/adding-a-gpg-key-to-your-github-account). This will be needed by the application when it uses the `git-crypt` command to secure secret fixture files.

### 5. Setup your application secrets

Search for `development.yml.enc` to locate the entry in the KeePass store
with the application's encrypted secrets files.

Run the following code to update the application for the corresponding
environments. **You will need to do this before running the test suite**.

```shell
# Help menu for the secrets command
bin/thor help lx-cli:secrets:edit
# Edit the secrets file (for the development environment)
bin/thor lx-cli:secrets:edit --environment development
```

### 5. Start up the application's services

```shell
.docker/bin/start
```

### 6. Initialize the database

```shell
# Get help with the DB setup command
bin/thor help lx-cli:db:setup
# Initialize the app store database
bin/thor lx-cli:db:setup --postgres
# Initialize the invoicing score database
bin/thor lx-cli:db:setup --mongodb
```

### 7. Start up the app

> You can also start up the app's non-dockerized services with the included IDE configurations for RubyMine in the `.ide-configs` folder.

This is the same command you'll need any time you want to start up the application:

```shell
bin/dev
```

## Running Storybook

> The `FeatureFlagsProvider` requires the application service running locally on port `6006` (currently broken, hence all features are disabled by default). This should be refactored to mock the response from `/api/features` and other endpoints needed to review components. See [this guide on mocking requests](https://storybook.js.org/docs/writing-stories/mocking-data-and-modules/mocking-network-requests) for more.

To review component stories, run:

```shell
yarn storybook
```

## Database management

### Resetting the databases

```shell
# To reset the active record database
bundle exec rails db:reset db:seed
```

## How to run the test suite

> TODO: Add test suite instructions

## Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

> TODO: Add services

## Deployment instructions

> TODO: Add deployment instructions

## Development

Review [the development guide](./md/DEVELOPMENT.md).

## FAQs

### RubyMine

#### How do I disable these "Missing type signature" errors?

> Go to `Settngs | Editor | Inspections | Ruby | RBS` and uncheck `Missing type signature`

## Known issues

### Deprecation notice for `fixture_path` in Rails 7.1

```shell
Deprecation Warnings:

Rails 7.1 has deprecated the singular fixture_path in favour of an array.You should migrate to plural:


If you need more of the backtrace for any of these deprecations to
identify where to make the necessary changes, you can configure
`config.raise_errors_for_deprecations!`, and it will turn the
deprecation warnings into errors, giving you the full backtrace.
```
